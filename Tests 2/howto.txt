Assignment 6 Marking Scheme for the parser.
===========================================

Setup:
    Create a directory `scratch'.
    Copy all the files from `test' into this directory.
    You can use this directory for each student.

Pre-testing:
    Copy the student's files into `scratch'
    If code does not compile, they get 0/30 on that portion of the assignment.

Things to check for before testing:
    Look at source files and make sure the code will not destroy all your 
    files.


Evaluation for Parser 
  Testing Functionality for the parser (15 / 30 marks) 
     Run ./test.sh   It will perform 15 tests
     The script will print out PASS or FAILED for each test.

     Each test is worth 1 mark.  I.e., subtract 1 for each failed test.

  Visual Code inspection for parser (15 / 30 marks)
    - There should be one function per nonterminal
    - There may be additional functions
    - Ensure code checks for too much input or closing parentheses

    +3 marks for overall program structure
    +2 marks for +, -, /, * evaluation
    +2 marks for car evaluation
    +2 marks for cdr evaluation
    +2 marks for cons evaluation
    +2 marks for list evaluation
    +2 marks for quotes not evaluated

    Deduct marks for general errors:
    -1 for minor typos or errors
    -2 for major errors


Note:  If the cover page is not present, deduct 10% from the overall
score.

Note:  Be sure to leave comments when you deduct marks anywhere in the 
       assignment, especially source code.
